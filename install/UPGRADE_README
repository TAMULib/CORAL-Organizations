Please Note:  If you are installing CORAL Organizations for the first time you
do not need to run this upgrade process.

The following file contains notes on specific upgrades.  For full instructions
on how to run an upgrade, refer to the technical documentation available at
http://coral-erm.org/documentation.

UPGRADING FROM CORAL ORGANIZATIONS VERSION 1.1 TO 1.2
-----------------------------------------------------

No database changes are required for this upgrade.  However, to use the
Resources sidebar, you need to add the following value to your configuration.ini
file:

    * resourcesDatabaseName=[YOUR RESOURCES DATABASE NAME] 


UPGRADING FROM CORAL ORGANIZATIONS VERSION 1.0 TO 1.1
-----------------------------------------------------

This upgrade contains coding and database structure changes only.  No changes
to the configuration file are required.

Database changes include:
    * Adding address field to contact and removing state and country fields
    * Update the address field to contain the previously used state and country data
    * Add view account tab indicator to User (for a future code-only upgrade)



For manual installation, you will need to first modify the upgrade_1_1.sql
script located in this directory to replace _DATABASE_NAME_ with your MySQL
schema name (e.g. coral_organizations_pprd). Next, run the upgrade_1_1.sql
script in your MySQL client.

The MySQL workbench and data model have both been updated with this upgrade.
